# WebProgramming-Project1
 Work done for the web programming class of the Interactive Media Design career. The work consists of the design of a web page / landing page for a product or service of the student's choice. The product chosen for this particular exercise is the VALORANT video game.
 
For some reason, the main font is not loaded by Github Pages. Also, the images of the caracters in the "Conoce a los Agentes" section (Section 3) do not load when you clic on them. Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause, but it is beyond my control.
